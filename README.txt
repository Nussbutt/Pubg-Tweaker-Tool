// Change History: Everything works?
//
// 04/16/2018 - Fixed a dumb error with finding normal sens. Still has pretty much no error checking.
// 05/03/2018 - *Updated* vertical sens fix (erases everything in input.ini). Added 3x and 6x scopes, fixed saving FOV setting.
// 06/27/2018 - slapped some duct tape on this so it *should* work on PUBG as of 06/27. Vertical sens shouldnt do anything anymore.
